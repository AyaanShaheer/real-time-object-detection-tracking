# real-time-object-detection-tracking
A real-time object detection and tracking system using YOLOv5 for detection and DeepSORT for tracking. This project demonstrates the ability to detect and track objects (e.g., people, vehicles) in a live video feed, showcasing skills in computer vision, real-time processing, and OpenCV.
